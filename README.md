# ðŸŽ¹ Raspberry Pi Digital Piano Rebuild

This project is all about giving a dead digital piano a second life â€” using a Raspberry Pi, a lot of experimentation, and some DIY determination.

The original piano's circuit boards failed, so I gutted the entire thing down to its essential hardware: keys, pedals, sensors, and speakers. The goal? Build my own digital piano from scratch using custom electronics and software, learning everything I need along the way.

## What I'm Doing

- **Reverse Engineering**: Figuring out how the original keyboard matrix, pedals, and sensors work.
- **Custom Electronics**: Replacing the original boards with a Raspberry Pi and other modular components.
- **Software Development**: Writing code to read keypresses, interpret velocity, and generate MIDI/audio output.
- **Sound Design**: Experimenting with audio engines (e.g., FluidSynth, SF2 files, etc.) to give it a rich, dynamic sound.

## Why?

Because I wanted to turn a broken, lifeless instrument into something smarter, more flexible, and entirely my own. It's a hands-on fusion of music, hardware experiments, and creative coding â€” a digital piano rebuilt from the ground up.
